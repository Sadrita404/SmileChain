# SmileChain Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**Reference-Based Approach:** Drawing inspiration from modern Web3 apps (Rainbow Wallet, Uniswap), gamification platforms (Duolingo), and social camera apps (Instagram Stories). The design balances playful engagement with the credibility needed for cryptocurrency handling.

**Core Design Principles:**
- Playful yet trustworthy: Fun smile-detection experience with professional crypto handling
- Instant feedback: Real-time visual response to user actions and smile scores
- Achievement-focused: Celebrate user success with prominent score displays and rewards
- Transparency: Clear token amounts, transaction states, and pool statistics

## Typography

**Font Stack:**
- Primary: 'Inter' or 'DM Sans' via Google Fonts (clean, modern Web3 aesthetic)
- Display/Scores: 'Space Grotesk' or 'Clash Display' (bold, attention-grabbing for numbers)

**Hierarchy:**
- Hero/Score Numbers: 3xl to 6xl, bold weight (smile scores, token amounts)
- Section Headers: 2xl to 3xl, semibold
- Card Titles: lg to xl, medium weight
- Body Text: base to lg, regular weight
- Captions/Metadata: sm to base, medium weight

## Layout System

**Spacing Primitives:** Tailwind units of 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16
- Component padding: p-6 to p-8
- Section spacing: space-y-8 to space-y-12
- Card gaps: gap-4 to gap-6
- Button padding: px-6 py-3 to px-8 py-4

**Grid Structure:**
- Mobile: Single column, full-width cards
- Desktop: 2-column layout (camera/action left, stats/leaderboard right)
- Max container: max-w-7xl
- Camera viewport: Centered, max-w-md on desktop

- Celo network badge/logo alongside wallet connection

**Camera Placeholder:**
- When camera not active: Friendly illustration or icon prompting user to start

**Hero Section:** None required - this is an app interface, not a landing page. Primary focus is the camera interface as the hero element.
